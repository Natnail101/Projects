        <p class="param">There are hundreds if not thousands of Endangered Species. Endangered Species are when a living organism is soon to be extinct from our planet. There are many reason why 
                            species are Endangered. The two huge factor of Species extinction are loss of habitat and the genetic variation.</p>

        <p class="para">In order to proctect the Endangered Species, we human have Governments and Organizations to work to protect the Endangered Species. There are laws that restrict hunting 
                            which means to those individual or organizations may face a huge fines. With this method, many species start to expand and get off from the Endangered status.

                        For example, during the 1970-1980, the government and the conservation organization repopulate the brown pelican. There was a site for the brown pelicans for the hatching with 
                            small access for human to go to the site. Then in 1980, the number of the brown pelicans has risened and soared. In the year 1988, the brown pelicans are off the Red List.
