            <h2 class="head2">The Red List</h2>
            <img src="asset/image/redlist.jpeg" alt="RED_LIST">
            <p class="para">The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has a list called the Red List which contains the list of threatened species to extinction. They are mostly managed by the government agencies, wildlife department,
                                Non-Governmental Organizations related to conservation, educational organizations, etc. Their responsibility is to develop biodiversity since the rate of biodiversity is now decreasing.
           
                There are seven levels of Conservation: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, extinct in the wild, and extinct.
                                In order to classify the species, has to do with the range and habitat. One area may have a healthy population, but another area will probably be critically endangered depending on the ecosystem.

            <h2 class="head2">The Loss of Genetic Variation</h2>
            <P class="para">A Genetic Variation is a the diverty of gene that is found in species. For example, we human have different trait such as hair, skin, or even an eye color. These are when species adapt to an enviroment. 
                                So in this case, the greater the population the species are then the greater there will be genetic variation. The group of species have the tendency to breed within the group which means they have a low genetic variation.
           
                Also, disease is much more in those species with low genetic variation and it can turn out to be deadly. Genetic Variation helps develope the resistence to the disease. Human activity can be one of the cause for the loss of genetic variation.
                                When people overhunt or overfish, then that menas there is a fewer breeding pairs for genetic variation.
