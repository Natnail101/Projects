            <p class="para">There are hundreds if not thousands of Endangered Species. Endangered Species are when a living organism is soon to be extinct from our planet. There are many reason why 
                                species are Endangered. The two huge factor of Species extinction are loss of habitat and the genetic variation.</p>

            <h2 class="head2">Endangered Species and People</h2>
            <img src="asset/image/Endangered-Animals-List.jpeg" alt="Endangered-Animals-List">
            <p class="para">In order to proctect the Endangered Species, we human have Governments and Organizations to work to protect the Endangered Species. There are laws that restrict hunting 
                                which means to those individual or organizations may face a huge fines. With this method, many species start to expand and get off from the Endangered status.
            </p>
            <p class="para2">
                For example, during the 1970-1980, the government and the conservation organization repopulate the brown pelican. There was a site for the brown pelicans for the hatching with 
                                small access for human to go to the site. Then in 1980, the number of the brown pelicans has risened and soared. In the year 1988, the brown pelicans are off the Red List.

            <h2 class="head2">The Red List</h2>
            <img src="asset/image/redlist.jpeg" alt="RED_LIST">
            <p class="para">The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has a list called the Red List which contains the list of threatened species to extinction. They are mostly managed by the government agencies, wildlife department,
                                Non-Governmental Organizations related to conservation, educational organizations, etc. Their responsibility is to develop biodiversity since the rate of biodiversity is now decreasing.
            </p>
            <p class="para2">
                There are seven levels of Conservation: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, extinct in the wild, and extinct.
                                In order to classify the species, has to do with the range and habitat. One area may have a healthy population, but another area will probably be critically endangered depending on the ecosystem.

            <h2 class="head2">The Loss of Genetic Variation</h2>
            <P class="para">A Genetic Variation is a the diverty of gene that is found in species. For example, we human have different trait such as hair, skin, or even an eye color. These are when species adapt to an enviroment. 
                                So in this case, the greater the population the species are then the greater there will be genetic variation. The group of species have the tendency to breed within the group which means they have a low genetic variation.
            </P>
            <p class="para2">
                Also, disease is much more in those species with low genetic variation and it can turn out to be deadly. Genetic Variation helps develope the resistence to the disease. Human activity can be one of the cause for the loss of genetic variation.
                                When people overhunt or overfish, then that menas there is a fewer breeding pairs for genetic variation.

            <h2 class="head2">The Importance of Endangered Species</h2>
            <img src="asset/image/Endangered-Flowers-That-Will-Leave-The-World-A-Little-Less-Beautiful_1.jpeg" alt="Endangered-Plants">
            <p class="para">The importance of an endangered species is the ecological system. When the endangered species increase, it indicate that the ecosystem is failing. We as human depends on ecosystem. Without variarity of ecosystem, 
                                then we won't have the forest, grassland, ocean, clean water, and clean air because of the contaimination. In this case, it also impact our won health risks.
            </p>
            <p class="para2">
                The primary goal of protecting endangered species is to repopulate the species. For the past few years, the number of animals and plants has been declining significantly. The reason for that is because those plants were on "take". 
                                The term "take" referred to by the Endangered Species Act was harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, kill, wound, captured, or collect. Federal law put special protection on Animals from being "take", sold, or traded. This goes for the plant
                                that is on Federal Property or if the Federal Action was involved, for example, RIT receives Federal Funding which means federal action will be taken if something happens to a specific species.
