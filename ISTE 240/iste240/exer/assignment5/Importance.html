            <p class="para">The importance of an endangered species is the ecological system. When the endangered species increase, it indicate that the ecosystem is failing. We as human depends on ecosystem. Without variarity of ecosystem, 
                                then we won't have the forest, grassland, ocean, clean water, and clean air because of the contaimination. In this case, it also impact our won health risks.
           
                The primary goal of protecting endangered species is to repopulate the species. For the past few years, the number of animals and plants has been declining significantly. The reason for that is because those plants were on "take". 
                                The term "take" referred to by the Endangered Species Act was harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, kill, wound, captured, or collect. Federal law put special protection on Animals from being "take", sold, or traded. This goes for the plant
                                that is on Federal Property or if the Federal Action was involved, for example, RIT receives Federal Funding which means federal action will be taken if something happens to a specific species.
