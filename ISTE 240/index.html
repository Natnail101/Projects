    <p id="para">Hi! My name is Natnail Tolossa. I was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I lived in the United States for the past 12 years which is since I was 7 years old. As of now,I am a first-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Before I enroll to RIT, I graduate high school as top 5 from Model Secondary School for the Deaf (MSSD).<img src="IMG_6011.jpeg" alt="">

    Now that I am RIT student, my goal is to make a change. I believe in the future. This job as a CIT can help me in a way to see the potential in human being. To be honest, I have many goals. But I have one thing that I would like to make improvement for my community as a deaf community and other community. I would like invent something for the deaf community and other community with language acquisition. This is one step of way for deaf community and other community can finally reduce the number of language deprivation. 

    As I work toward to that goal, I am now going toward to a Bachelor Degree as Computer and Information Technologies (CIT). So right now, I am preparing a schedule for the next semester and the next. First, I will be getting an associate degree. After I complete my associate degree, I will be going forward to bachelor degree. I will probably have both degree within 5 years. No matter the difficulty, I am going toward for the bachelor degree. Then just maybe, I will pursue for master degree. </p>

    <p>The project that I choose would be language deprivation and language acquisition
        I chose this project because throughout my middle school and high school, I've seen so many deaf kids struggle with language acquisition. It pushes me to learn about them and I can a learn some few things for myself because I used to be one of those kid who had a language deprived until I was 9 years old.
    
        As I design the website, I was hoping throughout this project, I would able to help young deaf kids or any kids that struggle with language acquisition. My plan is to spread the word and invent something for the people like parents, health workers, social workers, and many more. I want to use my research a way to give for deaf kids or any kids that are struggling with language acquisition. This can increase a great number of many deaf kids going to college and move on with their life with no struggle with language acquisition.
